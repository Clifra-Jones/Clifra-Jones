Hello, I am Cliff Williams (aka Clifra Jones)  

I am a 30 year IT engineer, systems architect, administrator, cloud architect, Data Base Administrator and part time developer.

In my GitHub reposititories you mostly will find things related to System, Cloud, Networking, Networking as a Service, etc. Administration. 
Much of which is centered on automation. The majority of my repositories are PowerShell modules such as the Meraki API Powershell module that allows you to use PowerShell to administer a Meraki Network as a Service. Another small module is the AWS_Tools_AddOns which adds a few usefull function when working with AWS S3 in PowerShell (look for more to come here)

Most of these projects are free to use and modify to your taste. If you wish to contribute to any of these feel free to do so.

Note: These are not my day job. I am a busy IT guy in a large corporation with a personal life. If you report an issue with one of my project and I don't respond in a timely manor please bare with me. If you have the skills you more than welcome to suggest the fix!
